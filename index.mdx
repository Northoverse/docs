description: "This NGO would add value to the community as a business incubation hub. Rather than replacing existing incubators and creating a competitive environment, it would leverage their services and other team members expertise to create comprehensive roadmaps for all types of local startups. 
These roadmaps would guide entrepreneurs from initial idea stage to reality, outlining all necessary steps to take before officially registering their company while providing in person services."

  <Card title="A Community based business incubation hub" icon="star" iconType="regular">
    Educational courses for students, Startup workshops for college students, Nessty AI app for startup applicants to create budget checklist or Business plan maker, and later other services like possibilities of startup events and business operations company to take care of time consuming business operations of a startup, as the organization grows
    ### Our concept works with these steps in mind:
    
    1. We are not providing funding or promising funds, we just help with business/start-up operations & assistance in the formation stage.
    2. Our concept has the non-profit approach to only get funds for employee pay for the initial period of the startup, and as time passes and we deploy more services and create revenue with for profit services which would be helping our founders after they complete the course or have registered the business.
    3. In order to create a large network of branches, adopting the franchisee/franchisor approach with this startup, while keeping it non-profit, to utilize the company’s pay route to get employee pay funding.
