## Our Planned Companies

We have a few companies planned for the future.

  <Card title="Northoverse - Community based business incubation hub, Non-Profit" icon="network-wired" iconType="duotone" href="/northoverse/nv" cta="YEAR1">
    The company would add value to the community as a business incubation hub. Rather than replacing existing incubators, it would leverage their services to create comprehensive roadmaps for startups.

    These roadmaps would guide entrepreneurs from initial idea to reality, outlining all necessary steps to take before officially registering their company.
