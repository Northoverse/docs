  <Card title="5hadow - Business Operations Management Company" icon="business-time" iconType="duotone" href="/ventures/corporation/shadow" cta="YEAR1">
    A company dedicated to acting as the complete back-office engine for startups and scale-ups, so that as the founder's vision grows and the demands of the core business intensify, they can offload all operational burdens to us. This allows founders to stop being part-time legal, HR, and finance experts and get back to being full-time innovators.

    With 5hadow managing the essential infrastructure, startups can scale faster and more efficiently, even if they lack the resources for a full in-house team, and this solid operational foundation will also help prepare them for international expansion and investment when the time is right.
