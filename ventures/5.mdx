  <Card title="Particle Factory - A drone manufacturing company" icon="drone" iconType="duotone" href="/particle-factory" cta="YEAR5">
    A company dedicated to applying our advanced manufacturing expertise to the defense and security sector by developing and producing next-generation unmanned systems, so that as global and domestic security challenges evolve and the demand for agile, intelligent surveillance and response tools grows, our defense and law enforcement partners have a reliable, technologically superior supplier. This strategic pivot allows us to leverage our proven capabilities in precision fabrication and supply chain management to serve a critical national security need.

    With Particle Factory focusing initially on the specific, pressing demands of island security—such as vast maritime patrol and rapid response over difficult terrain—we will establish a proven track record and a robust product line, creating a solid foundation to compete for larger defense orders and become a key partner in modern security infrastructure.
