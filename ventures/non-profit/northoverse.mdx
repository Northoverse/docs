title: "Northoverse - Business Incubation Hub"
description: "Northoverse is a next-generation business incubation hub empowering students, founders, and startups. We connect communities, educational institutions, and industry to guide entrepreneurs from idea to reality through mentorship, events, and strategic roadmaps. 

The company would add value to the community as a business incubation hub. Rather than replacing existing incubators, it would leverage their services to create comprehensive roadmaps for startups.   

These roadmaps would guide entrepreneurs from initial idea to reality, outlining all necessary steps to take before officially registering their company."
