# 🎒 The Student Ecosystem

Northoverse is deeply integrated into the academic fabric of Prince Edward Island. We view students not just as "learners," but as **builders in training**.

We have established permanent "nodes" within UPEI and Holland College to bridge the gap between **Theory (Classroom)** and **Practice (Startup)**.
