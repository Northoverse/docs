# ⏱️ What is a Northoverse Hackathon?

A Hackathon is not just about "hacking" computers. It is about **hacking problems**.

We bring together students from different backgrounds—coders, artists, business students, and writers—lock them in a room with pizza and caffeine, and challenge them to build a solution to a specific problem before the clock runs out.

## 🎬 Sample Scenarios: "What actually happens?"
*If you have never been to a hackathon, here is what the chaos looks like.*

### Scenario A: The "Tech" Pivot (The 2:00 AM Moment)
*A team of Computer Science students realizes their code is broken.*

<Steps>
  <Step title="Friday, 6:00 PM: The Idea">
    Team "CodeWarriors" decides to build an AI that identifies potato diseases (very PEI). They are excited.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saturday, 2:00 PM: The Wall">
    They realize they don't have enough photos of diseased potatoes to train the AI. The code isn't working. They panic.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saturday, 8:00 PM: The Pivot">
    Instead of an AI, they decide to build a simple **community forum app** where farmers can upload photos and *ask other farmers* for help. It's much simpler, but it works.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sunday, 10:00 AM: The Pitch">
    They demo the working forum. The judges love it because it connects people. They win "Best Community Solution."
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Scenario B: The "No-Code" Hustle (The Business Team)
*A team of Business and Art students with ZERO coding skills.*

<Steps>
  <Step title="Friday, 7:00 PM: The Panic">
    Team "BizWiz" realizes every other team has a programmer. They do not. They think they have already lost.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saturday, 10:00 AM: The Strategy">
    Instead of building an app, they build a **Mockup** using Canva and Figma. It looks like a real app, but it's just pictures.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saturday, 4:00 PM: The Validation">
    They leave the building and go to the local mall. They show their mockup to 50 strangers and get 20 email signups.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Sunday, 10:00 AM: The Pitch">
    While other teams show buggy code, Team BizWiz shows **proof of customers**. They win "Best Business Case."
  </Step>
</Steps>
