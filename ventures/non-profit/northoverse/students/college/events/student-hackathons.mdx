## 🎬 The "War Room" Scenarios
*What does a winning team look like at 2:00 AM?*

<Steps>
  <Step title="The 'Pivot' Moment">
    **Scenario:** It's Saturday, 2:00 AM. The API you planned to use is broken. The team is panicking.
    **The Fix:** The "Hustler" (Business Lead) realizes you don't need a live API for the demo. They fake the data using a JSON file. The "Hacker" hardcodes the frontend.
    **Lesson:** **Fake it 'til you make it.** Judges judge the *idea*, not the backend server stability.
  </Step>
  <Step title="The 'Pitch' Crisis">
    **Scenario:** Sunday, 10:00 AM. The code works perfectly, but the pitch deck is ugly.
    **The Fix:** The "Designer" spends the last 2 hours strictly on slides. They focus on the "Story" (The Problem) rather than the "Features."
    **Lesson:** **Storytelling wins checks.** A great product with a bad pitch loses. A good product with a great pitch wins.
  </Step>
</Steps>
