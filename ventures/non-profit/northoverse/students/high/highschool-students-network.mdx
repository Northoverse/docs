# 🎒 The High School Ecosystem

You don't need a degree to build a business. Northoverse connects high school students across Prince Edward Island to the tools, mentors, and money they need to launch real startups before graduation.

We treat high school founders like adults. No "lemonade stands"—we build real assets.
