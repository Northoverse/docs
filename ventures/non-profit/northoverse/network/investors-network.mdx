# 📝 The Investment Protocol
*You cannot just email these people. Warm intros are required.*

1.  **Readiness Check:** You must pass the "Investor Readiness" audit with our internal Finance EIR.
2.  **The One-Pager:** You create a 1-page "Teaser" document using the Northoverse template.
3.  **The Double Opt-In:** We send your teaser to the investor. If *they* ask for a meeting, we make the intro. This protects your reputation and theirs.
