# 🛑 House Rules (The Code)

_Northoverse is a community built on trust. Violation of these rules is grounds for immediate dismissal from the cohort._

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. The 'Safe Space' Rule" icon="shield-heart" iconType="solid">
    **What is said here, stays here.** In cohorts (especially Women Founders & Indigenous Pathway), members share vulnerable financial and personal details. Sharing another founder's private data or struggles outside the room is strictly prohibited.
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. The 'Give First' Rule" icon="hand-holding-heart" iconType="solid">
    **We are not a consultancy.** If you ask for help in Slack, try to answer someone else's question too. We build social capital by helping each other.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. The Attendance Policy" icon="clock" iconType="solid">
    **80% Minimum.** If you miss more than 20% of the live sessions without a valid medical or emergency reason, you will not receive your **Certificate of Completion** and you may forfeit your commitment fee.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. IP Ownership" icon="copyright" iconType="solid">
