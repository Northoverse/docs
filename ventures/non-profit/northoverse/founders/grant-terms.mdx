# 💸 The Northoverse Capital Strategy

Funding is not about "asking for money"; it is about **matching capital to risk**. At Northoverse, we teach a rigorous "Capital Stacking" strategy designed to minimize dilution (losing ownership) while maximizing runway.

**The Hierarchy of Capital:**
1.  **Non-Dilutive (Grants):** "Free Money." Hard to get, slow to arrive, but you keep 100% of your company.
2.  **Debt (Loans):** "Cheaper Money." You pay interest, but you keep control.
3.  **Dilutive (Equity):** "Expensive Money." You get cash and expertise, but you lose ownership and decision-making power.

## 🏛️ Tier 1: The Grant Landscape (Deep Dive)
*Grants are highly competitive. Evaluators look for economic impact (jobs created, exports generated), not just "cool ideas."*

### A. Provincial Programs (Prince Edward Island)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Innovation PEI: Ignition Fund" icon="fire">
    **The "Holy Grail" for Early Stage.**
    * **Amount:** Up to **$25,000** (Non-repayable).
    * **Format:** Competitive Pitch Competition (Dragon's Den style).
    * **Cycles:** Twice a year (Spring & Fall).
    * **Eligibility:** Must be a PEI resident. Business cannot be a retail shop or cafe (must be exportable/scalable).
    * **Northoverse Insider Tip:** The judges love "Export Potential." Don't just talk about selling to Charlottetown; talk about selling to Boston or London.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Innovation PEI: LaunchPad" icon="rocket">
    **Support for Commercialization.**
    * **Amount:** Up to **$15,000** (50% contribution).
    * **Use Case:** You spend $30k on marketing/legal; they reimburse $15k.
    * **Critical Rule:** You must be "Export-Ready."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="SkillsPEI: Post-Secondary Youth Internship" icon="user-graduate">
    **The "First Hire" Hack.**
    * **Amount:** Subsidizes **90% of wages** for a recent grad for up to 52 weeks.
    * **Math:** You pay a developer $50k/year. SkillsPEI pays $45k. Cost to you: $5k.
    * **Eligibility:** Employee must be unemployed/underemployed and a recent graduate.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### B. Federal & Regional Programs (Atlantic Canada)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="ACOA (Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency)" icon="water">
    **Program:** *Regional Economic Growth through Innovation (REGI)*.
    * **Amount:** $50,000 to $500,000+.
    * **Structure:** Often "Conditionally Repayable." This is essentially a **0% interest loan** with no collateral. You only start paying it back once you are generating revenue.
    * **The "Stacking" Rule:** ACOA money counts as "Government Money." You usually cannot use ACOA money to match Innovation PEI money. You need *private* cash to unlock this.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="NRC IRAP (Industrial Research Assistance Program)" icon="microchip">
    **For:** Deep Tech / R&D.
    * **Mechanism:** They pay the salary of your technical staff (Engineers/Devs) while they are building the product.
    * **The Gatekeeper:** You need an **ITA (Industrial Technology Advisor)**. You cannot apply online; you must be "invited" by an ITA.
    * **Northoverse Role:** We make the introduction to the local ITA for high-potential tech startups.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Black Entrepreneurship Program (BEP)" icon="hand-fist">
    **For:** Black-owned businesses.
    * **Offer:** Loans up to $250k and specialized mentorship.
    * **Partner:** Administered via FACE (Federation of African Canadian Economics).
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## 🏦 Tier 2: Debt Financing (Loans)
*When grants are exhausted, or you need cash *fast* (grants take 3-6 months), debt is the answer.*

### A. The "Friendly" Lenders (Development Banks)
*These organizations have a mandate to support economic development, so they take risks commercial banks won't.*

| Lender | Program | Terms (Est.) | Best For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CBDC** (Community Business Development Corp) | **Youth Loan** (Ages 18-34) | Prime + 2% | First-time founders with little credit history. |
| **CBDC** | **General Loan** | Prime + 4% | Buying equipment, renovations, or inventory. |
| **Futurpreneur** | **Startup Program** | Prime + 3% | Unsecured cash (no collateral needed) up to $60k. |
| **BDC** (Business Dev Bank of Canada) | **Online Small Business Loan** | Higher Rates | Fast cash ($100k) approved in 48 hours for established biz. |

### B. The "Big Banks" (CSBFL Program)
*Going to RBC/TD/Scotiabank directly is hard for startups unless you use this specific government program.*

**Program:** **Canada Small Business Financing Loan (CSBFL)**
* **How it works:** The Federal Govt guarantees 85% of the loan. If you go bankrupt, the bank only loses 15%. This makes them willing to lend.
* **Max Amount:** $350k for equipment/leasehold improvements.
* **The Catch:** You generally *cannot* use this for payroll or marketing. It must be for "hard assets" (Assets you can touch).
* **Personal Guarantee:** **Yes**, usually required (25% of loan value).

* **Build Ventures:** The major player in Atlantic Canada. Minimum check size is usually $1M+.

## 🧠 The "Stacking" Strategy (How to combine them)
*This is the 'Pro Strategy' we teach in the ETP course.*

**The Scenario:** You need **$100,000** to launch.

1.  **The Founder (You):** You put in **$10,000** (Love money / Savings).
2.  **The Loan (Futurpreneur):** You leverage your $10k to get a **$60,000** unsecured loan.
    * *Bank Balance:* $70,000.
3.  **The Grant (Innovation PEI):** You apply for LaunchPad (50% match). You show them you have $70k in the bank. They grant you **$30,000**.
    * *Bank Balance:* $100,000.

**Result:** You raised $100k, but only risked $10k of your own savings, and gave up **0% equity** to investors.

## ⚠️ The "Do Not Do" List (Red Flags)

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Merchant Cash Advances (MCAs)" icon="ban" iconType="solid" color="red">
    **Warning:** Companies like "FastCapital" or online "Instant Lenders."
    **Why:** Their APR (Interest rate) can be 40-80%. They take a daily cut of your bank account. Avoid at all costs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Paying Consultants for Grants" icon="user-secret" iconType="solid" color="orange">
    **Warning:** Consultants who ask for a "% of the grant" as a fee.
    **Policy:** While not illegal, many government agencies *hate* this. If ACOA finds out 20% of their grant went to a grant writer, they may audit you.
    **Solution:** Use **Nessty - AI** to write the grant yourself for free.
