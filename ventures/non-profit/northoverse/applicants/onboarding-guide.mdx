# 👋 Welcome to the Ecosystem
Congratulations on your acceptance. You are no longer just an applicant; you are a **Cohort Member**.

This guide outlines the **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)** for all Northoverse programs. Whether you are in the ETP, Women Founders Circle, or Indigenous Pathway, these are the rules of engagement.

## 🏁 Phase 1: Digital Setup (Day 0)

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Sign the Founder Agreement">
    You will receive a DocuSign link via email.
    * **Code of Conduct:** Confirms you will treat peers with respect.

    * **Media Release:** Allows us to photograph you at events (optional).
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Join the 'HQ' (Slack/Discord)">
    We do not use email for daily comms. We use Slack.

  </Step>

## 🚀 Phase 4: Outcomes (Pass vs. Pivot)

### ✅ If You PASS: The "Founder" Status
*You graduate from "Cohort Member" to "Northoverse Alumni".*

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="The Alumni Perks Package" icon="gift" iconType="solid">
    * **Fee Refund:** Your commitment deposit is returned 100%.
    * **Lifetime Access:** You remain in the Slack community forever.
    * **Grant Endorsements:** We write support letters for your funding applications (ACOA, Arts Council, etc.).
    * **Co-Working:** Discounted or free access to the physical hub desks.
    * **Talent Pipeline:** Priority access to our summer interns.
  </Card>
</Columns>

### ❌ If You DO NOT PASS: The "Pivot" Path
*Failure is part of entrepreneurship. We do not kick you out; we ask you to reset.*

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. The Debrief Meeting">
    You meet with the **Program Manager** to discuss why you didn't pass.
    * Was it the idea? (Market wasn't there).
    * Was it life? (You got busy/sick).
    * Was it fit? (You aren't ready for this stage).
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. The 'Try Again' Options">
    **Option A: Repeat the Cohort.**
    You can re-apply for the next cycle. (Note: Commitment fee is forfeited for the failed cycle).
    
    **Option B: Downgrade Track.**
    If the "Women Founders Circle" was too intense, we may move you to "ETP" to build stronger fundamentals first.
    
    **Option C: Pivot Idea.**
    Keep your spot, but kill the business idea. Start fresh with a new concept using the resources you now have.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Alumni Audit Access">
    Even if you don't graduate, you can often "Audit" future classes (watch quietly) to keep learning, though you won't get the dedicated mentor time until you re-enroll fully.
  </Step>
</Steps>
