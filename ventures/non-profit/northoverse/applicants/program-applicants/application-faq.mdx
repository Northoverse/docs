## 📝 Eligibility & Quotas

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="I am not a student. Can I apply?" icon="user" iconType="solid">
    **Yes!** 70% of our seats are strictly reserved for the **General Public**. You do not need any university affiliation to join Northoverse. We are a community NGO dedicated to helping citizens start businesses.
  </Card>

  <Card title="How does the 30% Student Quota work?" icon="graduation-cap" iconType="solid">
    To support the next generation, 30% of seats in every cohort are reserved for recent graduates of our College Network (UPEI/Holland College) who have completed the **Graduate Checklist**. If these seats aren't filled, they open up to the public waitlist.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Can I apply for the Accelerator (Track 2)?" icon="lock" iconType="solid">
    **Not yet.** Tracks 2 (Growth) and 3 (Deep Tech) are "Year Two" programs scheduled to launch in 2026. Currently, we are accepting applications for **Track 1 (Foundational)**. We recommend starting there to get your legal entity and basic operations settled.

## 💰 Funding, Equity & Partnerships

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Do you take equity for the program?" icon="chart-pie" iconType="solid">
    **No.** We do not take equity for participating in Track 1 programs (ETP, Women Founders, etc.). These are educational and support tracks provided by our NGO.
  </Card>

  <Card title="What is the 'Partnership Option'?" icon="handshake" iconType="solid">
    Upon successful graduation, high-potential companies may be invited to **Partner with Northoverse**. In this model, Northoverse takes a small equity stake or revenue share in exchange for providing **Managed Services** (Accounting, Legal, Event Management) to help you scale faster. This is optional.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Do I need to be incorporated?" icon="building" iconType="solid">
    **No.** In fact, a major benefit of the **Entrepreneurial Training Program (ETP)** and **Indigenous Pathway** is that our staff will assist you with the paperwork to incorporate your company, get a Tax ID, and open a bank account.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Is there a cost?" icon="dollar-sign" iconType="solid">
    **Subsidized.** Most Track 1 programs are free or have a small **refundable commitment fee** (e.g., $50) to ensure you attend the sessions. The fee is returned upon graduation.
