# 👋 Welcome to the Ecosystem

Congratulations. You are now a **Cohort Member**.

This guide outlines the rules of engagement during the program and the unique opportunity you have upon graduation: **The Northoverse Partnership**.

## 🏁 Phase 1: Program Onboarding (Day 0)
*Before you build, you must commit.*

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Sign Founder Agreement">
    **Standard IP Waiver:** You own your IP. We own 0%.
    **Code of Conduct:** Zero tolerance for harassment or discrimination.
  </Step>
  <Step title="2. Join Slack HQ">
    Introduce yourself in `#general`. Use the format: *Name | Venture Name | One "Ask"*.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3. Access Legal Portal">
    Book your "Incorporation Slot" with our NGO legal staff. We will handle your Minute Book and Articles of Incorporation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## 🎓 Phase 2: The Graduation "Fork"
*Upon successful graduation (and incorporation), you have two paths forward.*

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Path A: Independent Alumni" icon="person-walking-arrow-right" iconType="solid" color="#7f8c8d">
    **The Solo Path.**
    You graduate, keep 100% of your equity, and operate independently.
    * **Support:** Access to Alumni Slack & Monthly Mixers.
    * **Cost:** $0.
    * **Best For:** Lifestyle businesses, consultants, and solo-preneurs who want total control.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Path B: Northoverse Partner" icon="handshake" iconType="solid" color="#27AE60">
    **The Accelerated Path.**
    You sign a partnership contract to join the **Northoverse Portfolio**.
    * **The Deal:** Small Equity Stake (2-5%) OR Revenue Share.
    * **The Value:** Instant access to our **"Foundational Triad"** of service companies (see below).
    * **Best For:** High-growth startups that need to scale fast without hiring admin staff.
  </Card>
</Columns>

## 🚀 Phase 3: The Partner Ecosystem (The Triad)
*If you choose **Path B**, you unlock the full power of our "First Year Startups." We handle the noise; you build the product.*

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Northoverse (Non-Profit Hub)" icon="network-wired" iconType="duotone" color="#2980B9" cta="STRATEGY">
    **Role:** The Strategic Compass.
    Rather than replacing existing incubators, we leverage their services to create a comprehensive roadmap for you.
    * **For Partners:**
        * **Grant Stacking:** We write your grant applications for you (ACOA, IRAP, Arts Council).
        * **Mentor Matching:** Direct intro to our EIR (Entrepreneur in Residence) network.
        * **Roadmapping:** Quarterly strategy sessions to keep you investable.
  </Card>

  <Card title="5hadow (Operations Engine)" icon="business-time" iconType="duotone" color="#2C3E50" cta="OPERATIONS">
    **Role:** The Back-Office Machine.
    As your vision grows, the demands of legal, HR, and finance intensify. **5hadow** acts as your fractional COO/CFO so you can stop being a part-time admin.
    * **For Partners:**
        * **Legal:** Minute book maintenance and contract review.
        * **Finance:** Bookkeeping, tax filing, and payroll management.
        * **HR:** Hiring contracts and onboarding for your first employees.
    * **The Goal:** You focus on *Innovation*; 5hadow handles *Administration*.
  </Card>

  <Card title="1magined (Events & Media)" icon="party-horn" iconType="duotone" color="#E91E63" cta="VISIBILITY">

        * **Exhibitions:** Priority booth placement at Student and Startup Expos.
