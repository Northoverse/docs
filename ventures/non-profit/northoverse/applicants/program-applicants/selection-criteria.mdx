# ⚖️ How We Evaluate

At Northoverse, we do not just look for "unicorn" business ideas; we look for founders with the resilience, ethics, and community spirit to build them.

To ensure fairness across our **70/30 Quota** (General Public vs. Student Grads), our Selection Committee uses a specific framework that values **Life Experience** just as much as **Technical Skill**.

## 🧬 The "Northoverse DNA" (Universal Traits)
*Regardless of the track, every applicant is scored on these four core human qualities. If you score low here, a great business idea will not save the application.*

    **The Metric:** Can you listen without getting defensive?
    * **Green Flag:** "That's a great point, I hadn't thought of that perspective."

    * **Green Flag:** History of volunteering or mentoring others.

## 🎯 Track-Specific Scorecards

### 🔓 For Track 1 (Active Programs)
*Focus: Potential, Commitment & "Why Now". We bet on the Person.*

| Criteria | Weight | Specific Evidence We Look For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Commitment** | **40%** | Will you show up? For ETP, we need weekend availability. For Women Founders, we need evening consistency. |
| **Problem Clarity** | **40%** | Do you understand *who* is in pain and *why* current solutions fail? We don't care about your solution yet; we care about the problem. |
| **Why Now?** | **20%** | Why are you the right person to solve this? (e.g., "I worked in this industry for 10 years" or "I just graduated with this specific degree"). |

### 🔒 For Future Tracks (Growth & Deep Tech)
*Focus: Metrics, Traction & IP. We bet on the Data.*

| Criteria | Weight | Specific Evidence We Look For |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Traction** | **50%** | **Proof of Life:** Revenue, active users, LOIs (Letters of Intent), or a functioning MVP. |
| **Scalability** | **30%** | Can this grow beyond PEI? Is the TAM (Total Addressable Market) large enough to support venture scale? |
| **Team/IP** | **20%** | Do you own the Intellectual Property? Do you have the technical skills in-house to build it? |

## 📊 The Quota System (70/30)

We balance our cohorts to ensure diversity of thought.

| Applicant Type | Allocation | Evaluation Bias |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **General Public** | **70% of Seats** | **Bias: Life Experience.**<br/>We look for domain expertise (e.g., a nurse building a health app) and community connection. |
| **Student Grads** | **30% of Seats** | **Bias: Technical Skill.**<br/>We look for fresh ideas and modern tech stacks. Applicants must have completed the **College Graduate Checklist**. |

> **Note:** If the 30% Student Quota is not filled by qualified applicants, those seats are released to the General Public waitlist.
