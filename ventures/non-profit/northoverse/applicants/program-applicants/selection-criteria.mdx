# ⚖️ How We Evaluate

At Northoverse, our selection process is designed to be rigorous yet inclusive. We do not just look for "unicorn" business ideas; we look for founders with the resilience, ethics, and community spirit to build them.

To ensure fairness, our Selection Committee uses a **Standardized Evaluation Framework** that balances quantitative data (numbers) with qualitative traits (character).

## 🧬 The "Northoverse DNA" (Universal Traits)

_Regardless of which track you apply for, every single applicant is evaluated on these five core human qualities. If you score low here, a great business idea will not save the application._

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="1. Coachability & Humility" icon="ear-listen" iconType="solid">
    **The Metric:** Can you listen without getting defensive? We don't need you to agree with every mentor, but you must be open to new perspectives. We test this during the interview by offering a small piece of constructive criticism.

    - **Green Flag:** "That's an interesting point, I hadn't thought of that perspective."
    - **Red Flag:** "No, you don't understand, the customers are wrong."
  </Card>
  <Card title="2. Resilience (Grit)" icon="mountain" iconType="solid">
    **The Metric:** Evidence of overcoming adversity. Entrepreneurship is a series of punches. We look for history (personal or professional) where you faced a setback and kept going.

    - **Green Flag:** Sharing a specific story of a past failure and the _lesson learned_.
    - **Red Flag:** Blaming external forces (the economy, bad partners) for every past failure.
  </Card>
  <Card title="3. Community Mindset" icon="users-rays" iconType="solid">
    **The Metric:** Willingness to "Give First." Northoverse is an ecosystem, not a service provider. We select founders who will help their peers, share resources, and uplift the cohort.

    - **Green Flag:** History of volunteering, mentoring, or community organizing.
    - **Red Flag:** Viewing other cohort members solely as competitors to be crushed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="4. Resourcefulness" icon="toolbox" iconType="solid">
    **The Metric:** Doing a lot with a little. We love founders who "hacked" a solution together before asking for money.

    - **Green Flag:** "I used a free Google Form to test this."
    - **Red Flag:** "I can't do anything until I get \$50,000 in funding."

## 🎯 Track-Specific Scorecards

_Different stages require different metrics. Below is the exact breakdown of what the Selection Committee scores for each program._

### 1. For Early-Stage Training (ETP)

_Focus: Potential & Commitment (The "Zero to One" Stage)_

| Criteria            | Weight  | Specific Evidence We Look For                                                                                                                                 |
| :------------------ | :------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Problem Clarity** | **40%** | Can you articulate _who_ is in pain and _why_ current solutions fail? We don't care about your solution yet; we care about your understanding of the problem. |
| **Commitment**      | **40%** | Since you have no revenue, we bet on your hustle. Will you show up on weekends? Do you have the time capacity?                                                |
| **Why Now?**        | **20%** | Why are you the right person to solve this _right now_? (e.g., "I worked in this industry for 10 years and saw the waste.")                                   |

### 2. For Growth Tracks (Women Founders Circle)

_Focus: Viability & Scalability (The "One to Ten" Stage)_

| Criteria               | Weight  | Specific Evidence We Look For                                                                                                                                |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Traction**           | **35%** | **Proof of Life:** Revenue, active users, signed Letters of Intent (LOI), or a functioning MVP. We prioritize execution over ideas.                          |
| **Scalability**        | **25%** | Can this grow beyond a local small business? Does the business model allow for exponential growth (e.g., SaaS, Product) vs linear growth (e.g., Consulting)? |
| **Team Dynamics**      | **20%** | Do you have the right technical and operational skills on the team? If not, do you have a hiring plan?                                                       |
| **Financial Literacy** | **10%** | Do you know your unit economics? (e.g., Cost to acquire a customer vs. Lifetime value).                                                                      |
| **Impact**             | **10%** | Alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) or regional economic improvement.                                                                     |

### 3. For Community Tracks (Indigenous Pathway)

_Focus: Impact, Heritage & Sustainability_

| Criteria               | Weight  | Specific Evidence We Look For                                                                                                                        |
| :--------------------- | :------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Community Benefit**  | **50%** | How does this business serve the community? Does it create jobs, preserve culture, or solve a local issue?                                           |
| **Cultural Integrity** | **30%** | Does the business honor traditional knowledge respectfully? Is the founder authentically connected to the community they claim to serve?             |
| **Viability**          | **20%** | Is there a basic path to financial sustainability? We don't need "Unicorn" growth, but the business must be able to support the founder financially. |

## 🚩 Automatic Disqualifiers (The Red Flags)

_Applications containing these elements are typically rejected during the initial screening phase._

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="The 'Get Rich Quick' Scheme" icon="ban" iconType="solid" color="red">
    **What it is:** Multi-level marketing (MLM), gambling systems, vague crypto/forex trading schemes, or "passive income" bots. **Why:** These do not align with our mission of sustainable value creation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="The 'Outsource Everything' Founder" icon="user-xmark" iconType="solid" color="red">
    **What it is:** An applicant who says, "I have the idea, I just need Northoverse to find me a developer to build it for free while I manage." **Why:** We support _builders_. You must be willing to do the work, learn the skill, or hire the talent yourself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ethical & Conduct Violations" icon="thumbs-down" iconType="solid" color="red">
    **What it is:** Rudeness to staff during the interview, discriminatory language in the application, or a business model that exploits vulnerable populations. **Why:** We protect our culture fiercely. One toxic founder can ruin a cohort.
  </Card>

| **5** | **Exceptional** | **Idea:** "Unicorn" potential or massive community impact. <br /> **Founder:** Obsessive customer empathy, resourcefulness, and an inspiring leader. <br /> **Action:** Priority Accept + Scholarship Consideration. |

> **Note on Diversity:** In the event of a tie between applicants (e.g., two applicants with a score of 4), priority is given to founders from underrepresented groups to ensure a balanced and diverse cohort composition.
