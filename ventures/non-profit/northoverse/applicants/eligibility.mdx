## 📝 Common Application Questions

<Columns cols={1}>
  <Card title="Can I apply to more than one track?" icon="question" iconType="solid">
    **Yes.** However, we recommend focusing on one primary track at a time to get the most value. For example, you can complete the **ETP (Training Program)** first, and then apply for the **Business Plan Assistance** once your idea is solid.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Do I need to be incorporated?" icon="building" iconType="solid">
    **No.** Most of our programs (ETP, Indigenous Pathway) are designed to help you _get_ incorporated. Only the **Women Founders Circle** generally prefers businesses that are already established entities.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Is there a cost?" icon="dollar-sign" iconType="solid">
    **Most programs are fully subsidized** by our partners and grants.

    - **Digital Classrooms:** 100% Free.
    - **Indigenous & Women's Tracks:** May have full Scholarships available or May have a small commitment fee (refundable upon completion) to ensure attendance.
