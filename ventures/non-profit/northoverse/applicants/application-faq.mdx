## 📝 General Application Process

<Columns cols={1}>

  <Card title="How do I apply for a program?" icon="pen-to-square" iconType="solid">
    **Applications are submitted online** through our portal. Each program (ETP, Women Founders, etc.) has its own specific application form. Simply navigate to the program page and click "Apply" to begin the intake questionnaire.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Can I apply to more than one track?" icon="layer-group" iconType="solid">
    **Yes.** However, we recommend focusing on **one primary track at a time** to get the most value. For example, you can complete the **ETP (Training Program)** first to validate your idea, and then apply for the **Business Plan Assistance** track once your concept is solid.
  </Card>

  <Card title="What happens after I submit my application?" icon="hourglass-start" iconType="solid">
    Our specialized selection committee reviews applications on a rolling basis. You will typically receive an email confirmation immediately, followed by a status update or interview request within **5–10 business days**.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Can I re-apply if I am not accepted?" icon="rotate-right" iconType="solid">
    **Absolutely.** We encourage persistence. If you are not accepted, we will provide feedback on why (e.g., the idea needs more research, or the cohort was full). You are welcome to improve your application and try again for the next cycle.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Do I need a full team to apply?" icon="users" iconType="solid">
    **No.** Solo founders are very welcome, especially in the **Entrepreneurial Training Program (ETP)**. However, for the **Women Founders Circle**, having a core team in place can be beneficial for handling the workload.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Is there an age limit?" icon="id-card" iconType="solid">
    **Generally, no.** We accept applicants from High School age (16+) to retirees. However, applicants under 18 may require a parent/guardian consent form for legal liability reasons during events.
  </Card>

## 📋 Eligibility & Requirements

<Columns cols={1}>

  <Card title="Do I need to be incorporated?" icon="building" iconType="solid">
    **No.** Most of our programs (ETP, Indigenous Pathway, Business Plan Assistance) are designed to help you *get* incorporated. We guide you through that process. Only the **Women Founders Circle** generally prefers businesses that are already established entities.
  </Card>

  <Card title="I am an Indigenous founder, how do I verify eligibility?" icon="feather" iconType="solid">
    We operate on a model of trust and inclusion. While we may ask for self-identification regarding First Nations, Métis, or Inuit heritage to ensure the **Indigenous Pathway** resources reach the right people, we generally do not require strict federal status cards for initial entry.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Does my business idea need to be 'Tech'?" icon="microchip" iconType="solid">
    **No.** Northoverse is industry-agnostic. We welcome social enterprises, retail concepts, service businesses, arts organizations, and tech startups. If it's a business, we can help you build it.
  </Card>

  <Card title="I am an international student, can I join?" icon="passport" iconType="solid">
    **Yes.** If you are currently residing in the region on a valid student visa, you are eligible for our programs. However, please note that we cannot provide legal immigration advice regarding starting a business while on a visa.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Do I need a finished business plan?" icon="file-lines" iconType="solid">
    **Not for ETP or Indigenous Pathway.** Those programs help you write one. However, for **Business Plan Assistance**, you should have at least a rough draft or raw data ready so our strategists can help you refine it.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Is the Women Founders Circle inclusive of non-binary founders?" icon="venus" iconType="solid">
    **Yes.** The program is a safe space designed to support anyone who identifies as a woman or non-binary individual navigating the specific challenges of the business world.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Will my idea be shared publicly?" icon="bullhorn" iconType="solid">
