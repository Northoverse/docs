# 🌟 Our Story

Three years ago, a vision was born: to create an incubation ecosystem that bridges education, startups, and industry — a hub where students, early-stage founders, volunteers, and collaborators could come together to transform ideas into reality.  

Northoverse started as a bold experiment: connecting classrooms, colleges, and startups with a mission to nurture talent, accelerate innovation, and foster a collaborative roadmap for ambitious entrepreneurs.
