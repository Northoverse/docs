title: "Particle Shredder - A 3D Printing Filament Manufacturing Company"
description: "A company dedicated to closing the loop on plastic waste by transforming local discarded materials into premium 3D printing filament, so that as environmental concerns grow and the demand for sustainable manufacturing materials increases, communities and creators have a direct way to contribute to a circular economy. This allows individuals to exchange eligible plastics for credits, diverting waste from landfills while empowering makers with affordable, eco-conscious supplies.
With Particle Shredder establishing this recycling-to-production pipeline, we not only build a loyal customer base but also secure a cost-effective, locally-sourced raw material stream. This foundational model will allow us to first supply individual buyers and 3D printing farms, and then vertically integrate by using our own filament to manufacture proprietary products, creating a fully sustainable, local manufacturing ecosystem."
