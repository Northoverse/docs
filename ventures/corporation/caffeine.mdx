title: "Caffeine - A space agency"
description: "A company dedicated to securing humanity's future as a multi-planetary species by developing advanced, autonomous systems for planetary security and orbital operations, so that as our presence in space expands and the strategic importance of celestial resources grows, nations and corporations have a partner capable of ensuring safety and sustainability beyond Earth's atmosphere.
This mission builds upon our legacy of precision manufacturing and unmanned systems, pushing the boundaries of technology to create space-capable drones for orbital maintenance, asteroid monitoring, and planetary reconnaissance.
With Caffeine focusing initially on critical infrastructure like securing lunar and Martian outposts for relay stations to create a proven slingshot highway for fast automated payload delivery in space and monitoring orbital traffic, we will establish the essential frameworks for interplanetary security and resource management, enabling a safe and accelerated era of space expansion for all."
